Hello! This is my first time using sequelize to build a data model about Marvel characters.
I have watched all of the Marvel movies at the moment (except Spider Man...seeing it this week!)

I have synced and seeded some data of alive and decease Marvel characters.
In any case that there are changes, you can add or delete the characters infomation.

There are spoilers if you click on the link and see what characters are alive or dead!

Enjoy:)
